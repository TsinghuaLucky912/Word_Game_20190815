hello There are are   you miss 
May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy Always put yourself in others shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts the other person, too.

The happiest of people  necessarily have the best of everything;they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for only they can appreciate the importance of people

who have touched their lives.Love begin
